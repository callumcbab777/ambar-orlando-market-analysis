# AMBAR Orlando Market Landscape

Static, single-folder site. Open `index.html` directly (works offline, except map tiles) or host the folder anywhere.

Marriott brands are the main focus (AMBAR is part of the Marriott family); key non-Marriott upper-upscale and luxury hotels are included for a fuller picture. The Marriott Brand Matrix section stays Marriott-only.

## Structure
- `index.html`: page shell
- `assets/css/styles.css`, `assets/js/app.js`: design and rendering. All content comes from `data/comps.json`
- `assets/ambar-logo.png`: AMBAR logo cropped from Callum's brand graphic
- `assets/fonts/`: self-hosted Cormorant Garamond + DM Sans (SIL OFL)
- `assets/vendor/`: Chart.js 4.4.4 and Leaflet 1.9.4, bundled so the page needs no CDN
- `data/comps.json`: the single source of truth. `data/comps.js` is an auto-generated mirror so that `file://` opening works

## Adding a new week
1. Drop the new brief into `../briefs/` as `marriott-orlando-brief-week-of-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (same format as the existing ones).
2. Run `python3 update_data.py` (or `python3 update_data.py path/to/brief.md`).
3. The script replaces that week's rates and news, keeps the curated sections (hotels, brands, demand context, market), and records any missing Monday as a gap.
4. Optional: add that week's events under `context["YYYY-MM-DD"]` in `comps.json` and update `looking_ahead`/`market`, then re-run the script so `comps.js` is regenerated.

Status values: `OK` (rate shown), `UNAVAILABLE` (no offer for a one-night search), `NOT_COLLECTED` (calendar returned no prices / hotel not yet in the landscape).
